# Asana Global Task View

This chrome extension shows all Asana tasks assigned to you across all of your workspaces. 

Asana has long been my favorite personal management tool, but the inability to see a global view of "what do I have to do" was annoying. This extension aggregates all that you have to do (i.e. everything assigned to you) and shows it to you in a single page.

As a personal note, this is my first run at a lot of dev tools that I haven't used:  Chrome extension, unit tests, many build tools (Babel, Browserify, Gulp, etc.), and React so I welcome any criticism. 

Still under construction :)

## To Do

- [ ] Decide on file structure
- [ ] Figure out how to connect with Asana API
- [ ] Write out process chain
- [ ] Figure out the JSON API output
- [ ] Write unit tests (figure out how to use Mocha)
- [ ] Make popup mockup
- [ ] Identify UI hierarchy (popup and options)
- [ ] Static popup page (React, HTML, CSS)
- [ ] Static options page (React, HTML, CSS)
- [ ] Identify minimal state rep
- [ ] Identify state location
