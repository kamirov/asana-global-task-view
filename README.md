# Asana Global Task View

This extension shows all Asana tasks assigned to you across all of your workspaces. As a bonus, you can mark a task as completed right from the extension.

Asana has long been my favorite personal management tool, but the inability to see a global view of "what do I have to do" was annoying. This extension aggregates all that you have to do (i.e. everything assigned to you) and shows it to you in a single window.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo.

1. Navigate to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).

1. Enable Developer mode.

1. Load the `extension` folder as an unpacked extension.


## Initialization

1. Sign up for an [Asana](https://asana.com) account.

1. Get an Asana [Personal Access Token](https://app.asana.com/-/account_api) (click on "Manage Developer Apps", then "+ Create New Personal Access Token"). Specify this token in the extension's Options page.

## Usage

1. Complete tasks by clicking on them or tabbing to them and hitting either Enter/Space.

1. Check "Only show my tasks" to only show tasks where you are one of the assignees. Leave this unchecked to see all tasks (good for if you use Asana alone or you want to keep track of others' tasks);

1. Check "Only show today's tasks" to only show tasks that are due today.
