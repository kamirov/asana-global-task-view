# Asana Global Task View

This chrome extension shows all Asana tasks assigned to you across all of your workspaces. 

Asana has long been my favorite personal management tool, but the inability to see a global view of "what do I have to do" was annoying. This extension aggregates all that you have to do (i.e. everything assigned to you) and shows it to you in a single page.

As a personal note, this is my first run at a lot of tools that I should've gotten familiar with ages ago:  Chrome extensions, unit tests, many build tools (Babel, Browserify, Gulp, etc.), and React so I welcome any criticism. 

Still under construction!
